# -- models --
# Create models for your custom data tables in the database.
# This is the core of Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
# You use it to define fields and relationships between different entities in your database

# -- AbstractUser --
# Djangoâ€™s built-in User model
# Already includes important fields like:
    # username
    # email
    # password
    # is_staff
    # is_active

# You can add additional fields to this user model, such as (date_of_birth, profile_picture, or phone_number,... )
